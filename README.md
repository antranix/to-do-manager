# To-Do Changelog Manager

A VS Code extension that helps you manage **to-do tasks** and **project changelogs** directly from dedicated side-panel views, keeping your development workflow organized and your release notes always up to date.

The extension provides **two visual interfaces**: one for managing To-Do items and another for building and maintaining a structured `CHANGELOG.md`.
